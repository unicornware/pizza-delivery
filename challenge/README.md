# Pizza Delivery

## Part 1

A delivery person is delivering pizzas to an infinite two-dimensional grid of
houses. She begins by delivering a pizza to the house at her starting location;
a dispatcher then calls via radio and tells her where to move next. Moves are
always exactly one house to the north (`^`), south (`v`), east (`>`), or west
(`<`). After each move, she delivers a pizza to the house at her new location.
The dispatcher has been a little spacey lately, so she sometimes ends up
delivering more than one pizza to the same house.

Here are some examples:

- `>` delivers pizzas to two houses: one to the house at the starting location,
  and one to the house directly east of the starting location.
- `^>v<` delivers pizzas to four houses in a square; the house at the
  starting/ending location ends up with two pizzas.
- `^v^v^v^v^v` delivers a bunch of pizzas to some very lucky people at only two
  houses.

Given the string of dispatcher inputs in [this file][1], how many houses receive
at least one pizza?

## Part 2

The next day, to speed up the process, the delivery person rents a
pizza-delivering goat. She and the goat begin at the same starting location, and
they both deliver a pizza to this starting house. She and the goat then take
turns moving based on the dispatcher's instructions.

Here are some examples:

- `^v` now delivers pizzas to three houses; The delivery person goes north and
  the goat goes south.
- `^>v<` now delivers pizzas to three houses; The delivery person and the goat
  both end up back where they started.
- `^v^v^v^v^v` now delivers pizzas to 11 houses; The delivery person treks north
  and the goat treks south.

Given the same string of dispatcher inputs as in [Part 1](#part-1), how many
houses receive at least one pizza?

## Guidelines for your solution

Please provide a solution that answers [Part 1](#part-1) and [Part 2](#part-2)
in a modern programming language.

By design, this is a fairly simple exercise, so we're hoping for solutions that
reflect what you consider well-factored production-quality code. The best
solutions will be elegant, as well as correct. Feel free to pull in any
libraries you like.
